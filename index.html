<pre>
	Work was hastily done as we were aroused with vanitas vanitatum, our minds quickly attempting to 
compute the most accurate sentence that was possible with a limited time span, typing to find a website we could 
call close to picturesque. This feeling of uncertainty reigned over our existence. Philosophers like Plato assume that 
ethics/justice doesn't always apply. If one is situated in the back of the undefinable room that tortures our acumen 
levels into early tiredness, then it is possible to extrapolate the expectation of Plato & Socrates's journey on finding 
virtue for the human experience. This virtue for us being the future progression of a quality website capable of an 
acceptable critique of our mundane journey across the Arrakis desert for a long hour and thirty minutes. No 
interaction that is unreasonable with the contemplated goal is allowed to pass, we exterminate any annoyance (like 
those random bugs in our tenacious code). The experience of going to war for an endless (hour and thirty minutes on 
specifically Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays around 8 pm) amount of time only allows us to 
emulate what will happen in the preceding moments of your day, usually ending horrifically. Our (Macintosh era 
code—that's what I'm calling it now) first generation apropos to our website had an ephemeral existence, we added a 
couple of new design updates to make it more visually pleasing to the individual who identifies with OCD. All of 
this (rather simple) writing was done to acknowledge the man who didn't want to be venerated, a survivor of WWII; 
Alexey Petrovich Maresyev.

	We had a couple jobs to fill in to make this work. Some roles were being a Writing manager, a Code 
manager, and a Sources Manager. My role was writing, I reviewed all writing and came up with a possible solution 
that is approbated by all. A couple critics thought that my writing was too impertinent, so I decided to make a 
specific page more mild when it comes to the aggressivity of the message (it’s supposed to be a book review…). 
Nevertheless, I “crunched” through to make the message(s) more direct.

	Lars had various of coding ideas via HTML, meaning that he is the one who came up with the template for 
the website. When Github was rejecting our smacking of our track pads, Lars would be the one to find a way to 
make Github work. In the beginning when we were working on our website on a random compiler, Lars had some 
experience with a fascinating website called Github. “This website makes publishing HTML creations easy. And it’s 
free.” Lars said. This claim was of course accepted with zen-like head bows because obviously I won’t risk exposing 
my existence. “Yes. Yes.” I state idiotically…… Lars always had a solution to a problem with regards 
to our use of Github. To get into detail, the compiler we used for the first version of our website was 
https://tinyurl.com/yd7qnfgv. The very same website soon helped us implement the new bar menu that was more visually 
pleasing according to our Source manager. To indicate that the user was on  a specific page we used W3.CSS code to 
make the black buttons white, this gives visual information to the user helping the feeling of cleanness throughout 
the entire experience. [Here’s the old code for the website: https://tinyurl.com/y34b9gs2 (Just paste the code into the Tutorialspoint.com compiler 
site to see the old version)]

	The Source manager, Sophia, worked on the bibliography and examining a couple of books to participate in 
giving accurate information about Alexey Petrovich Maresyev’s certain human will. Citing, listening, translating, 
processing, various documents/books (The Story of a Real Man by Boris Polevoi and other insightful websites), and 
documentaries on his journey across the snowy forest (biography page has more information on his experience). 
Overall, it all worked out, all images were slowly cited despite being absent, nothing changed, everything went 
smooth even without much time.

	Our disregarded champion was less of a warrior (even though there’s enough information to assume he is a 
warrior, apparently he shot down 46 planes in one day) and more of a dedicated survivor. He crashes in 
a forest in the grasp of winter. His acclaimed aircraft Polikarpov I-16 beneficial during this era (recovered by the military to 
materialize it into scrap later when it was found). He was temporarily alienated during the catastrophe due to the 
demolished engine. Surprised to have lived the crash, Alexey suddenly interacted with a brown bear that appeared. 
Alexey shot it with a gun. After this courageous occurrence, he went through rigorous efforts to make it back to his 
comrades. 18 days in the forest without many possible virtues, the only reason to live was survival. The thought of 
being with his friends was enough to help him engage in deep purpose. He made it into a Russian home that 
happened to have an experienced doctor that took care of him until the rare encounter of his friend Andrei. Everyone 
celebrated his success, a pilot that didn't want special service at Moscow—he wanted to be beside his friends. A 
normal man with astonishing determination for survival. People called him a hero, a legend. A real man.

	This man is without a doubt, an unsung hero. He actively didn’t want to be acknowledged because he felt 
certain he wasn’t supposed to be a legend (Alexey Maresyev’s humble behavior: “There’s nothing extraordinary in 
what I did. The fact that I’ve been turned into a legend irritates me.” -Alexey Petrovich Maresyev. Truly a wondrous 
person). Either Maresyev’s story has become obsolete at the current moment, or it is popular outside of the US 
(Russia). He was incipient during the 1940s, and especially popular with historians, less with the general public, it’s 
possible that historians lost interest in Maresyev. Maresyev’s story is very standard when it comes to heroic figures.

	The interviews we selected were less useful than the book selected by our Source manager. Most of the 
sources that involved listening to experiences by others can be biased, thus creating a different character that may be 
irrelevant by claiming Maresyev was something when he was nothing extraordinary. I would take the Russian 
interviews with a critical mind in order to identify anything that may seem unreasonable, or irrelevant to the actual 
topic. Most interviews are in Russian, you can read the transcripts instead. 
    
	Designing a website in an expedient way was our intention. We aspired to go for a less modern appearance 
during the beginning and focus more on the writing and processing of data. The data was processed accordingly, 
thus our first version (still called the Macintosh era version) was meant to simply help us get to know what we 
needed vis-a-vis productivity, it is very easy to fall into the strenuous route of making the guise of the actual website 
look good, losing focus on the actual personality. We made sure we honored the revered historian legend. Macintosh 
era version of the website includes #C6C4BC background color (light-gray-beige-ish color), Georgia gray-blue 140 
percent font size as standard throughout all pages, images of Maresyev and Polikarpov I-16 both with 104-pixels for 
width & height, more bullet point explanations, and nonsense for the summary. The newer version has a better 
design overall, W3.CSS navigation bar, white button implementation that confirms exactly what page your on, 
minimalistic color assortment, better formatting using “<pre></pre>”, new interview page instead of writing code 
directly into the “More info” page, the bibliography is actually finished, spelling errors have been resolved, height is 
now 200-pixels with a specific width to make images more clear, font-family is still Georgia for captions with a new 
size of 80 percent, and useless information has been eliminated. Everything is easy to use without the Macintosh 
era/1984 guise with no personality (you could say that the 1980’s appearance has some kind of personality if you’re 
typically mundane).
